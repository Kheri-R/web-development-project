                <p>It was really nice having mzee as a therapist. I feel like I started to explain and understand my feelings much more. I was able to talk about my feelings. What I found very amazing was how compassionate he was, and how his tone of voice was very soothing and comforting.</p>
                <p>Best Therapist! Very fruitful collaboration which triggered many discoveries and changes. I would recommend him to everyone. Great price-Value Relationship.</p>
                <p>I felt safe to explore and talk about my issues to mzee. He understood me! Yes, someone other than me understood what I was going through. For many years, I thought I was crazy. He taught me that I wasnâ€™t crazy, and there, I started to be and feel like a human!</p>
